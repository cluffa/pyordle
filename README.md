# wordpy
A simple command line wordle clone. Scores are saved to a SQL database. Global leader boards and game history are printed at the end of a game.  

I created this game to practice SQL and Python. 

I have made some game design changes that make it different than the official game. There is no special conditions for double letters. For example, the first n in the word runny would be red in the official game. I also decided not to include a guess limit. I want the focus to be on getting the answer in fewer guesses and not just guessing it. This makes the leader boards and scoring based on guesses and not win/loss ratio.
